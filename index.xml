    <description>Notes Binomial Observations Coefficients: When a binomial is raised to a power, it’s coefficient corresponds to the values of a specific row. Example *Corresponds to 4th row of pascals triangle Exponents: When a binomial is raised to a power, it’s exponents approaches towards, or recedes away from Example Binomial Theory a diminishes from n to 0 b increases from 0 until it reaches n r increases from 0 until it reaches n There are terms in total The coefficient of a term is given by The sum of the exponents of and is the row Questions Example 1 Tip Remember binomial theorem.</description>

    <description>Notes What is a Recursive Sequence? A Recursive Sequence is a sequence where the value of one term is based upon the previous terms of the sequence. Recursive Formula Formula that permits us to calculate a term, using the previous terms of the sequence Fibonacci Sequence The Fibonacci Sequence is a recursive sequence with the equation of: In general there are 3 components to a recursive formula The beginning terms A formula Restrictions Restrictions does not go below 1 For a lot of Recursive Sequences you will need restrictions.</description>
