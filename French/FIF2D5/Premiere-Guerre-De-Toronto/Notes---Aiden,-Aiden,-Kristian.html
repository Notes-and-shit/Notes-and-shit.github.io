<ul>
<li>The opening scene is a boxing match</li>
<li>Napoleon Bouvier is knocked down on the floor</li>
<li>He gets up but he gets up to fast and becomes dizzy</li>
<li><strong>Alfonso Bunelli</strong> is his opponent, a boxer from the new italian neighborhood/district
<ul>
<li>The rumors were true, he not only hits hard but fast</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The clock rings signaling the end of the third round
<ul>
<li>Napoleon still dizzy from the knockdown drags himself to the corner where his coach is</li>
<li>His coach tells him he’s not doing enough, he needs to dance more in order to dodge his punches</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Napoleon, even though he’s badly hurt, is not tired</li>
<li>He looks at the crowd watching him, he recognizes some of their faces like Thomas and his other friends from work. But the person he’s looking for, Corine, isn’t there</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>
<p>She hasn’t quite decided yet whether to go to the match or not</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The violence of the match makes her so worried that she almost faints</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>On top of this, she’s got a lot of work to be done. Notably a latin exam to prepare for the following day.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>She decides to go to the match</p>
<ul>
<li>When she gets they’re he’s down on the floor
<ul>
<li>She calls his name</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>And while he’s on the floor he hears her voice and he gets a boost of motivation</li>
<li>He’s very happy to see her</li>
<li>He won’t let benelli humiliate him in front of his girlfriend</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>After a series of punches bouvier delivers the final blow and KO’s Bunelli</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>He approaches Corine and says Sunday after church he wants to go to the park with her, he says he has something important to say</p>
<ul>
<li>She doesn’t have time to reply, his friends rush towards him and hoist him on their shoulders
<ul>
<li>Meanwhile a group of people surround bunelli, notably a woman with black hair</li>
<li>Corine thinks to herself would she end up like that woman if bouvier was knocked out</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>The reward for this lightweight match is not enormous but it’s well deserved</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Corine thinks Bouvier will ask to marry her on that day</p>

<li>It’s Bouvier’s 17th birthday</li>
<li>He’s in the factory working, the same thing he’s been doing for 3 years now</li>
<li>Thomas Jobin, his friend at the factory tells him to not work too hard after his fight yesterday
<ul>
<li>Thomas is also his childhood friend who grew up with him back in cabbagetown</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>He thinks back to the number one rule of boxing: know how to take the blows as well as you give ‘em. Which is why he’s still working.
<ul>
<li>In Cabbage town, a disadvantaged area, he never missed the opportunity to train and practice combat</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The head of the factory (Mr.Comte) approaches Napoleone, he congratulates him on his boxing win (although says it’s not his sport)
<ul>
<li>He says to Thomas that he’s worried he’s not doing enough work, they’re expecting sleds to be high in demand this year</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Bouvier rolls his eyes, he thinks that if you put a hammer in the bosses hand he wouldn’t know what to do
<ul>
<li>Everyone at the factory suspects that Alfred Gendron (the factory owner) hired him out of pity</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>He questions his spot working in the factory, but also mentions that the only other place he could find more french people in is at church</li>
<li>For 30 years the Gendron factory has been the center of work for exclusively francophones
<ul>
<li>Many even think Alfred Gendron is losing profit by never denying a french canadian in need of a job</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>He then says he’s better working here than Europe, where the war is going on
<ul>
<li>But in a strange scenario the war has upped the economy in canada
<ul>
<li>More weapon factories means more jobs</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>He doesn’t see himself working in the factory for 15 or 20 or 30 more years</li>
<li>He dreams of getting out of his parent’s apartment and going on his own path. He thinks boxing will be his way out</li>

</li>
<li>
<p>They take Queen road on the tramway, to High Park</p>
<ul>
<li>They talk about the mayor of Toronto on the way, Mayor Church. They say he’s an orangiste. Which means he’s against catholics, specifically french (because the english are protestant). Corine remarks he’s anti-catholic, francophobe.</li>

<li>
<p>It’s been a year since he’s enlisted</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When he enlisted, the enlister said “Bouvier like the dog”</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>He’s in the middle of a boxing match</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>He gets knocked down, he sees the gray sky, the mounds of earth, the barbed wire, the mud, and his comrades in their uniforms surrounding him</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>“Had enough frenchy”, Ted Mckenna (his opponent) says</p>
<ul>
<li>He gets up and nods no</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>He’s in battalion 48 Highlanders de toronto</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>He’s made some friends but also encountered hostility</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Quebec’s growing opposition to the war, and especially to the Canadian government’s conscription plan, prompted some english Canadians to accuse french Canadians of a lack of patriotism</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Arriving at the Valcartier military training camp, Napoleon met soldiers from the 22nd battalion</p>
<ul>
<li>Having found himself in the 22nd battalion he surely would have avoided the prejudices to which he was victim</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>When one of the soldiers in his regiment recognized Bouvier, he proclaimed in front of the others that their unit had among there’s a frenchy, and an outstanding boxer</p>
<ul>
<li>They called him by the nickname frenchy since</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>However, he detected in some soldiers a hurtful tone when they spoke to him</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>By January 1917 they had sailed to England. And after a few weeks of training in a miserable muddy camp, he was now up in the country of his ancestors</p>
<ul>
<li>He thought he had gone through the worst, but that couldn’t be further from the truth</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>His battalion was commanded by from the top by the British generals</p>
<ul>
<li>They were launched into a succession of battles</li>
<li>Nothing would’ve prepared him for the horrors of war</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Even when the army had victory it was little consolation for the amount of lives lost</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>On April 9th 1917 they took control of Vimy Ridge, something though to be impossible by the British</p>
<ul>
<li>The price of this victory was 3600 deaths</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Napoleon who has accustomed to punching his opponents down was shocked to see bullets from his rifle take down opponents down instead</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>After Vimy they got a short rest, but things quickly became miserable</p>
<ul>
<li>They would win a couple more battles but it didn’t matter</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>The bad conditions caused a gloomy mood in the air</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>And repressed aggression from Canadians caused them to attack their own brother’s in arms</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Mckenna issued a challenge to Bouvier for a boxing match</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Mckenna expected him to back away but he didn’t he’d had enough of the Orangiste</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>They fought bare fist, bare chest</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>After they fight a bit, and Napoleon comes back in the fight and knocks McKenna down Colonel Davis comes in and tells them to stop</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Mckenna says “you win this time Frenchy”</p>

<li>Thanks to the job she was able to accumulate savings for her year of training at the school and support her family</li>

<ul>
<li>
<p>For 11 days Napoleon’s section has been progressing relentlessly</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>One step at a time, despite their heavy losses the Canadians persisted against the German defenses at Passchendaele.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The mud cuts down their ranks the most. Dozens of soldiers fall into water-filled shell crates where they end up trapped in the deadly slime and drown.</p>
<ul>
<li>The Canadian troops devoted more effort into making wooden bridges to cross mud then to the assaults against the German.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Two days ago, Napoleon voted for the first time in his life in a federal election.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>All his comrades supported the Borden conservatives and their promise to impose conscription in Canada.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>But Napoleon voted for the liberal party. He was wrong to enlist and wants to prevent other young people like him from going through hell.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The british high command no longer has any idea over the reality of the front: they order commands as futile as they are useless like the capture of Passchendaele which was costly in lives (commanded by the general Haig)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Suddenly, a shell (explosive projectile from cannons) (obus eclate) explodes to the right of him and the impact forces Napoleon to the ground</p>
<ul>
<li>During a long 30 seconds, Napoleon lays in the mud and thinks about just staying there, he thinks about how this battle doesn’t matter and how if they take this town under control or not, it doesn’t matter. It’s insignificant to the war in it’s entirety.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>“Frenchy help me,” Ted screams.</p>
<ul>
<li>Bouvier snaps out of it</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>At the bottom of a crater created by the explosion, he distinguishes a large silhouette, sunk in the mud up to the waist (Ted)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>German machine gunners spot targets and open fire at Bouvier. Bullets whiz around Napoleon as he runs towards Ted</p>
<ul>
<li>Just as he reaches the crater a painful burn shoots through his right arm</li>
</ul>
</li>

<p>Bouvier! Shouts Colonel Davis, who is leading the attack</p>

<li>Julie Arsenault has a feeling in her back that somebody is watching her</li>
<li>The head of a young soldier in the first bed, covered in bandages turns towards her</li>
<li>She can make out two eyes passed the bandages
<ul>
<li>His eyes are prisoners to a deformed face she remarks</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The patient, David Peterson was admitted to the Spadina military hospital the day before</li>
<li>Julie and him are the same age, 20 years old</li>
<li>The lower part of his face was torn off by a shell explosion in the summer of 1916</li>
<li>She saw his face right before his operation
<ul>
<li>The surgeon had to use a skin graph in order to cover up the hole that showed his teeth through his face</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>She advances to David Peterson’s bed and touches his hand</li>
<li>Then she goes back to preparing the free bed made possible by the deceased person that died by sickness over the night</li>
<li>The feeling of being surrounded by hurt men has been a common experience during her past two years in her various assignments in toronto and before that in military hospitals in europe</li>
<li>Wearing her uniform with its long white dress and loose gray tunic does not highlight her feminine charms</li>
<li>She thinks of Peterson and all the other young soldiers with their bodies mutilated by the war
<ul>
<li>Has poor David who can’t even speak at this moment ever experienced love?</li>
<li>Will he ever be able to find a woman who would put his mutilations aside and love his heart</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The notion of love for those who face death and horrors in war seemed uncertain
<ul>
<li>The experience of always being at risk of death puts most men in the army into the arms of the first woman who accepts them, or even prostitutes</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The floor above room H (where Julie works) is filled with 240 patients suffering from STDs caused by sex
<ul>
<li>Are these ephemeral and imprudent relationships due to love or to the fear of perishing without having satisfied their sexual desires. Julie thinks to herself.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Although, the British and their pragmatism, set up in 1915 a national rule to combat STDs.
<ul>
<li>Among its various functions it distributes condoms to troops in order to prevent the STD transmission</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>She hugs the pillow from the bed to her chest, she can’t blame people like David for looking at her in such a way</li>
<li>During her long working days she often dreams about love. At least she can still dream about it, while for David and so many others in the military hospital’s of Europe…</li>
<li>After she’s finished she notifies Mme. Neale, the head nurse, that the bed is ready for another patient</li>
<li>In the corridor she meets a priest. The vicar of Sacre-Coeur Church in Toronto. Rodrigue Lussier.</li>
<li>He asks her if she likes Toronto. She questions if she really likes it in Toronto. It is far away from Gaspesie, her home.
<ul>
<li>And contrary to her home, she’s in an area that’s almost completely anglophone</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>However she’s very happy having left the past behind her
<ul>
<li>At least her patients are in the process of recovering and not bloody, fresh from the front lines</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>When her boss offered her the position here she did not hesitate
<ul>
<li>She wanted at all costs to get away from the the increasingly harmful effect that daily exposure with the wounded was having on her
<ul>
<li>Although, she would’ve preferred and assignment in Quebec where she had completed her nursing training</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>She’s actively working on her english (although still has a strong accent)</li>
<li>And she actively explores the city in her free time</li>
<li>The vicar says he enjoys the city (he arrived 5 months ago)</li>
<li>The vicar, at 27 is in his second parish since leaving the seminary of saint-hyacinthe  in quebec</li>
<li>He says he’s going to the third floor to greet the patients</li>
<li>The Canadian needs spiritual support (referring to a french canadian patient), you should tell them to go to the mass on their break from the hospital. The vicar says.</li>
<li>The vicar finds this place disgusting but still came</li>
<li>His priest, Father Phillipe Lamarche, before Lussier, was serving the franco-ontarians alone spiritually</li>
<li>Her head nurse who had known the vicar had introduced Julie to the priest, since then she’s gone to one of the three sunday masses without fail</li>
<li>At Sacre-Coeur she discovered a small french speaking island in the sea of english speaking people</li>
<li>He asks if he’ll see her next sunday, she says yes</li>
<li>She’s not unaware of her effect on the church
<ul>
<li>When she shows up she gets lots of attention from single men</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The priest has expressed in the past a want for her to hook up with one of the dudes in the church</li>
<li>Although, she’s denied many date requests from these men</li>
<li>She is completely devoted to her work and doesn’t want to run the risk of deceiving any of them who may want long term relationships</li>

<li>After a while corporal price asked him a question “I know that you all came back from the war wounded but why are you so silent”</li>
<li>“You will see” said Napoleon (while silently thinking back to Passchendaele the place that had transformed them all into ghosts)</li>
<li>Then he was ordered to embark, so he wished Price good luck and hoped his war would be short and less painful than his</li>

<li>The reputation of the mayor wasn’t exaggerated, the prodigious ability to be able to memorize all the names and faces of the soldiers that he meets</li>
<li>Then Tommy Church stops in front of Napoleon and says “you, I don’t recognize you.”
<ul>
<li>Note from teacher: This implies that although he can memorize everybody’s name, he purposely chooses to not memorize Napoleon’s name because he’s an Orangiste (racist against french people and catholics)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>McKenna introduces Napoleon as Frenchy Bouvier, elaborating that his friend is from Cabbagetown, Toronto</li>
<li>The face of the mayor frowns, he cannot set aside his contempt for Catholics, French ones at that, even if he’s wearing a military uniform.</li>
<li>“He’s my friend,” McKenna adds. “He risked his life to save mine in Passchendaele.</li>
<li>The comment sparked a positive change in the Mayor’s attitude, who smiles and extends his right hand towards the Franco-Ontarian. “Welcome home, my boy”.</li>
<li>But the mayor’s smile fades away when Napoleon presents him with his left hand. “My right arm is paralyzed due to a injury, Mr. Mayor”</li>
<li>Tommy Church quickly clasps Napoleon’s hands with both his and moves on to the next soldier. “I wish you a quick recovery”</li>
<li>Nurse Neale sees McKenna and tells motions to him that he needs to be transported to the hospital</li>
<li>McKenna asks Napoleon if he’s gonna see his people before he arrives at the hospital, to which Napoleon says yes</li>
<li>Despite the Crowd of people around the train station Napoleon has never felt so alone. He knows the directions to his neighborhood but his feet refuse to move</li>
<li>Suddenly, a hand presses against his paralyzed arm.</li>
<li>He feels as if he’s dreaming until he feels Corine’s warmth snuggled against him.</li>
<li>She said she almost didn’t make it due to an accident on Queen street
<ul>
<li>She’s panting from running</li>
<li>She’s very happy to see him</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>He tries to talk but he’s too moved, but he knows he’ll regain his speech in due time unlike his arm</li>
<li>He knows that he will probably never be able to rely on his closest ally again (because he uses his arms to box) because of a german bullet lodged in his arm for two weeks.</li>

<ul>
<li>Wouldn’t you be better off with your parents? Corine asks
<ul>
<li>Napoleon hears it but hesitates to answer
<ul>
<li>After a month spent at the Spadina hospital he doesn’t know how to answer.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>He stares at the young woman holding his left hand (Corine), she visits him every day</li>
<li>However, his questions about his muscle therapy and his consultations with the doctors end up irritating him.</li>
<li>So far, despite all the exercises, his right arm remains paralyzed.</li>
<li>Unlike most of the soldiers, Napoleon is dressed and wears his uniform during the day.</li>
<li>Yes, of course. He says finally.</li>
<li>But I’m not demobilized yet. And my parents don’t need a cripple at home.</li>
<li>Corine turns away from Napoleon, wipes away the tear forming in the corner of her right eye.</li>
<li>Since he’s returned, he seems to have lost that energy that made him so formidable in the ring.</li>
<li>Corine still loves him, but she ignores how to help him escape his torture</li>
<li>They get interrupted when he has his appointment with dr. Sullivan</li>
<li>Corine smiles at Julie, she thinks he’s lucky to have ended up on her floor</li>
<li>She appreciated how she was always smiling and speaking to them in their language</li>
<li>Julie even takes the couple under her care, she takes Napoleon to the Sacre Coeur mass (otherwise he would choose to stay locked up in the hospital)</li>
<li>Although Corine feels a little jealous in front of the nurse’s striking beauty, she laos admires her calm confidence and the fact that she found her professional calling</li>
<li>Corine leaves for work</li>
<li>Before Napoleon goes to the doctor Julie pulls a newspaper from her pocket and asks Napoleon what the article is about.</li>
<li>The article reads “700 deaths from the plague” and it’s from the Toronto star</li>
<li>Occasionally the nurse pretends to have difficulty reading english, in order to give Napoleon a job and a sense of value</li>
<li>It’s the Spanish flu, he says. The disease spread to a garrison of Spanish soldiers in Morocco where it caused eleven deaths. In Spain itself there have been more than 700 deaths so far.</li>
<li>My god! Julie says.</li>
<li>I heard in Liverpool, british sailors talking about the disease and that it’s a type that spreads extremely fast.  American soldiers contracted it in march. Napoleon said.</li>
<li>700 dead, that’s horrible!</li>
<li>It’s nothing. Napoleon says (his dry tone surprises Julie). Even if the illness gets worse, we won’t hear about it, the soldier continues. Censorship will hide it from us, just as it hides what’s really happening on the front lines.</li>
<li>Julie notices an agitation in the right hand fingers of Napoleon. The nurse sees an opportunity to administer shock therapy to her patient.</li>
<li>“Why are you letting yourself be defeated, Napoleon? Julie asks. You took a terrible blow, but you don’t even try to recover from it.</li>
<li>The nurses’ questions and judgment off puts Napoleon (like a punch to the jaw). He likes Julie, and appreciates her kindness, but what right does she have to speak to him like that? He gets angry. The rage, the boiling blood of the former boxer rises in his veins. “What do you know!”</li>
<li>Julie, taken back by the sudden hostility, also gets angry. “Since you’ve been here you’ve just felt sorry for yourself!”
<ul>
<li>Grateful that the other patients don’t understand French, she raises her voice further. “Have you looked around? The others, like your friend McKenna are all more crippled than you. Do you hear them lamenting? Over there, David Peterson only has half a face left! I am convinced that if you give your arm a chance to heal and you put in the effort you will eventually be able to use it again!”</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Napoleon trembles with rage. And Julie begins to fear what she’s instigated. He raises his arm and screams “Have you ever seen a boxer with only one good arm?”</li>
<li>Suddenly, Napoleon feels the warmth of Julie’s hands on his right hand which have become that of a boxer again. His right hand is curled in a fist.</li>
<li>Could I have really hit her? Napoleon asks himself. “I’m not that crazy am I?”</li>
<li>He’s about to speak but Julie tells him that he needs to get to his appointment</li>
<li>Behind his back Julie smiles. The Americans are in Europe now. If the news is true the war will soon end and life will return to normal. The nurse thinks.</li>
<li>As she passes Peterson’s bed he stares at her and says “I didn’t understand what you were saying but I am sure you are doing wonders” he says.</li>

<li>Father Abbot Philips Lamarche is talking to Charles Sirois (Corine dad)</li>
<li>They talk for a bit then he asks for a copy of the law (this is a magazine i guess)</li>
<li>Corine, go and find it for the priest. Charles says.</li>
<li>The young woman who was listening to the conversation of the two men from the counter of her father’s store goes to the back fo the store in search for the magazine</li>
<li>When she gets back they engage in serious conversation. They talk about how the population of the city is changing.</li>
<li>Over the course of 20 years it’s doubled. Half a million inhabitants.</li>
<li>But it’s not just the number, it’s the number of immigrants, specifically immigrants from england</li>
<li>In 1901 ¾ of total people in toronto were born in Canada, now its 60%</li>
<li>People from the UK represent ⅓ of the total population with 150 000 members</li>
<li>It’s for good reason that Toronto is becoming British Charles remarks, Britain is 5 times larger in presence than it was at the beginning of the century</li>
<li>Just like Corine, the priest is used to the rants of the queen merchant (charles)</li>
<li>Charles refuses the coin handed to him by the priest for the magazine</li>
<li>Why do you think conscription is so strong in toronto the priest asks.
<ul>
<li>Charles says it’s because of all the people from england</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The priest, who doesn’t like discussing politics changes the subject by asking Corine a question</li>
<li>How is Napoleon doing Corine? He asks.
<ul>
<li>Better, and better she replies</li>
<li>She feels the priest would like her to say more, like for example her plans for the future with him (marriage)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>But Charles returns to the rescue. He mentions the big rally tomorrow to promote the army recruitment. “The so called patriots will just launch more attacks against French-Canadians”</li>
<li>I hope you’re wrong. Says the priest. He then thanks Charles and leaves the store.</li>
<li>Corine thinks about her fathers remarks, she also hopes it will be wrong.</li>

<ul>
<li>“If you want to box, go to the gym.” Julie says to Napoleon who is enjoying gently hitting Ted McKenna’s open palms with his fists.</li>
<li>For three months, his right arm has gradually regained strength, at least enough for him to use his right hand.
<ul>
<li>After barely 30 strikes against Ted he feels fatigued.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Two weeks ago he was released from the hospital to be assigned to the military training camp downtown where he performs easy chores.</li>
<li>However he still spends a lot of time at the hospital, either seeing a doctor, visiting his friend, or volunteering to help Julie and her colleagues. This delights Julie.</li>
<li>But him and ted have to leave in this moment to go to a patriotic meeting</li>
<li>They get on the public transport, most of the passengers are wearing there best dress (because church)</li>
<li>He would’ve preferred to walk to the sports center where the “Towards victory” assembly was held but he decided to take public transport in order to accompany his disabled friend</li>
<li>When they arrive Corine scolds them for being late</li>
<li>They sit in the seats.
<ul>
<li>Music plays
<ul>
<li>Soldiers begin to parade as the music play.</li>
<li>The 48 Highlanders march out, Corine squeezes his arm</li>
<li>She notices a tear falling from Ted’s eye. Is he moved to see his colleagues parading or sad to no longer be able to accompany them she thinks. Both, she concludes.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>She feels growing sympathy for Ted since she’s met him because she foresees the various challenges ahead</li>
<li>The parade ends</li>
<li>Conscription which the government is planning on voting for soon divides the country</li>
<li>Even if in Toronto the only voices heard are those pro-conscription, in Quebec during the December elections, the province voted massively against it. The opposition to conscription is becoming more and more intense</li>
<li>In Quebec city between march 28 and april 2nd a series of violent gestures against conscription degenerated into riots</li>
<li>On the evening of April soldiers called reinforcements from Ontario to restore order fired into the crowd. Results: 4 dead and 70 injured</li>
<li>Speakers on the podium remind us of the need to redouble our efforts to win the war even if final victory is within reach</li>
<li>Then a soldier climbs onto the podium to highlight the Veterans Association’s support for the conscription</li>
<li>He has a strong British accent. He launches into a rant against opponents of the conscription without hiding his contempt or hatred about French canadians. He says they are neither Canadians nor the french. They are traitors.
<ul>
<li>Thunderous applause rumbles through the crowd</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The faces of Corine and Napoleon turn pale as they feel a hostility in the air</li>
<li>He grabs Corine and says they must leave. His blood boils with rage.</li>
<li>Once they are away he says. “What country did I fight for? Are the French Canadians really worse than the Germans in the English’s eyes?”</li>
<li>Corine tries to calm him. “They are just fools carried away by the fever fo war.”</li>
<li>“You’re right Corine, war brings out the best and worst in people” but as he finishes his sentence he turns to see a man looking at them with an indignant look</li>
<li>The man says “You should speak white here!”</li>
<li>Corine is scared of what might ensue but Napoleon says calmly. “My dear sir, I will speak French whenever I want, I fought in the war. Where were you during this time? Comfortably at home. My fiancee makes weapons in the factory for our troops. If you were less old and if i my arm wasn’t injured it’s very likely i would’ve punched you”</li>
<li>The old man is suddenly stunned and runs off the train</li>
<li>An applause from the people in the train ensues and Corine kisses him “Words, when they express the truth, can strike even harder than a punch”</li>

<ul>
<li>Turbulence hangs in the air of the city this afternoon</li>
<li>The allies have blocked further German advances</li>
<li>On his way to the military hospital, Napoleon senses discontent among the people he meets in the streets. He has the impression that everyone is anticipating a painful autumn and then another interminable winter.</li>
<li>The military had predicted the war would be won before christmas 1914</li>
<li>Napoleon is on leave for 2 days</li>
<li>His right arm is still actively improving</li>
<li>The barack dormitory at the training camps are spartan</li>
<li>His duties there are not demanding</li>
<li>He even has lots of free time to visit the hospital</li>
<li>He no longer knows what gives him more pleasure, chatting with Ted or helping Julie Arsenault
<ul>
<li>His preference surely leans towards the nurse he thinks</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>When he arrives in room H, Napoleon is surprised to find his friend standing about to leave.
<ul>
<li>He asks him where he is going</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>“We have to show them that the men who return from the war, we won’t accept how they treat us once we return, then we will no longer let them turn a blind eye to the presence of enemies among us!”</li>
<li>McKenna then beings to summarize the events that lead him to this stage</li>
<li>The previous evening, Cluderay, a soldier returning from Europe, found himself in the White City Cafe on Yonge street.</li>
<li>He got into a fight with the customers and a waiter, a greek, that is to say, a foreigner from an allied country</li>
<li>The spat escalated into a fight and the soldier suffered a gash on his forehead</li>
<li>But, it was the soldier who was arrested and charged with being drunk in a public place</li>
<li>This rumor had circulated among a group of people, McKenna added</li>
<li>Tonight, a group of people will go to White City Cafe to teach them a lesson</li>
<li>You can accompany me, Frenchy. Says Ted.</li>
<li>Napoleon is perplexed by his friend’s agitation, then experiences contradictory feelings.
<ul>
<li>He catches the eye of Juie who is obviously aware of the story. Her eyes beg him not to join the soldiers.</li>
<li>Then he thinks a cool ahead among these heated minds will serve to calm things down</li>
<li>Also, he can’t let Ted go alone. If things get carried away he might get hurt.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Napoleon smiles shyly at Julie, who quickly turns away from him
<ul>
<li>“She can’t understand,” sighs Bouvier deep inside. They are my brothers in arms.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>“They give jobs to foreigners, but not Canadians returning from France!”. The comment elicits approval from a group of noisy men that continue to grow in front of the restaurant at 438 Yonge Street.</li>
<li>Ted McKenna raises one of his crutches in the air in a threatening gesture.</li>
<li>Surprised to find himself in such a large and openly hostile crowd, Napoleon becomes worried.</li>
<li>The crowd in front of the White City Cafe spills over the sidewalk and ends at the busy thoroughfare (l’artere achalandee)</li>
<li>Among the men in uniform, Napoleon recognizes some of his comrades from his battalion. And he notices civilians letting free reign of their anger.</li>
<li>Among this crowd of 200 men, he feels completely incapable of stopping the growing wave of resentment.</li>
<li>He understands the frustration, especially for cripples like Ted who have to live with the after-effects of their sacrifice. Where can they direct their anger?</li>
<li>“Tonight we want justice!” shouts a large soldier, raising a fist with his one arm</li>
<li>On both sides, protestors demanded the release of soldier Cluderay, arrested the day before</li>
<li>“Send foreigners to the army and to the front” yells Ted while he hits the restaurant window with his crutch.</li>
<li>The impact shatters the window into a thousand pieces.</li>
<li>Did Ted do it on purpose or by accident? Napoleon asks</li>
<li>Suddenly, men rush towards the interior of the establishment. They begin to destroy everything they can get their hands on.
<ul>
<li>Employees and customers flee the scene</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Horrified, Napoleon tries to pull Ted away but Ted keeps encouraging the others to continue their work</li>
<li>Shortly after, when there was nothing left to break, a soldier shouted at the top of his voice: “I know another greek restaurant on Bloor street”</li>
<li>The pack moves towards the given address, 985 Bloor Street West</li>
<li>Napoleon urges his friend to return to the hospital.
<ul>
<li>But McKenna accepts the invitation of a man who offers to drive him in his car to go to the riot</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Napoleon hesitates, abandoning his friend who has lost his mind? Despite his doubts, he takes a seat in the car with Ted. “If he continues, I will knock him out to stop him,”Bouvier promises.</li>
<li>At the second restaurant the police are notified of the violent activity and arrive on the scene</li>
<li>Although, they were scared of the sheer amount of people there and decide not to intervene</li>
<li>Then they go to a third business, the police try and stop them this time but they fail</li>
<li>Then the crowd stops in front of Superior Lunch restaurant</li>
<li>But as they’re about to attack a soldier says that they have veterans among their employees</li>
<li>So, when night falls, the march resumes</li>
<li>The police called for reinforcements and then erected a roadblock on yonge street</li>
<li>However, the rioters attacked the police who responded in a physical manner.</li>
<li>Distraught, Napoleon sees Ted jumps into the melee</li>
<li>Ted gets into a fight with the constable but Napoleon soon intervenes</li>
<li>The constable, startled by Napoleon drops Ted on the ground and Napoleon gets into his boxing position</li>
<li>His right fist hits the police officer square in the jaw, there’s a great pain in his arm</li>
<li>He K.Os the police officer then runs to his friend Ted</li>
<li>He says if you don’t come with me this time you’ll be the next person I knock out. Ted agrees.</li>
<li>Despite the suffering, he thinks “my fist regained it’s strength, but i may have lost it for good”</li>

<li>“Happy birthday, Napoleon” somebody says</li>
<li>He’s having sex with Corine he thinks</li>
<li>Suddenly he realizes the hair of the girl he’s staring at is black</li>
<li>This is not Corine, this is Julie</li>
<li>“Wake up!”</li>
<li>Napoleon opens his eyes</li>
<li>The voice of sergeant thomas wakes him up</li>
<li>He gets out of bed and rubs his face</li>
<li>The 5 seconds of warmth from this are quickly interrupted by the coldness of the morning</li>
<li>What could’ve inspired a dream like this? He thought.</li>
<li>The day before he was just fine hanging out with Corine
<ul>
<li>After a supper together celebrating his birthday with her, he wisely went to the barracks</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>“Hurry up the work awaits us”
<ul>
<li>The sergeant continues to exploit the poorly woken soldiers	 into working</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Like the others Napoleon goes to the washroom and does his business quickly</li>
<li>He has just turned the legal age to join the army, where he had already spent 2 years of his life
<ul>
<li>Looking back, this period of time seemed very long, there were so many painful experiences
<ul>
<li>The man who was in such a rush to enroll, is now waiting impatiently to receive his discharge from the army</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Surely he’s not the first person who’s dreams liven up the night, could this be a sign he needs to get married soon</li>
<li>A little after breakfast sergeant Thomas informs the men in his platoon of their assignments for the day</li>
<li>“It seems that you like hanging out in hospitals, Bouvier. Then, in the following days you’ll be treated well.”</li>
<li>He is designated to be part of a detachment responsible for assisting staff from the Hospital at R.A.F base.</li>
<li>He joins a group of 10 men who walk by foot to the building situated at the corner of Gerrard and Church</li>
<li>The municipal building, loaned to the military to support the war effort. Was used to house patients from the royal air force.</li>
<li>There were patients wall to wall</li>
<li>The head of the hospital, Colonel Hardy, pairs Napoleon with a member of the air force.</li>
<li>“Roland Michener” Declares the young man who extends his hand to Napoleon.
<ul>
<li>“I’m from Red Deer in Alberta, I’m going to be a pilot if I can ever finish my training here.”</li>
<li>“I never thought emptying chamber pots and transporting sick people would be a part of it, but the functioning of the RAF is mysterious.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Bouvier who is still a little helpless follows the orders of Michener who is just 18</li>
<li>They go to corridor lined with sick people, some lying in beds some on the ground</li>
<li>“What’s happening here?” says Napoleon</li>
<li>Michener motions for Napoleon to take the other end of a stretcher where a man lies muttering unintelligible words</li>
<li>“This one needs to be taken to the (spanish) flu room” Michener says</li>
<li>“What’s happening is that there’s too many sick and not enough space. This hospital was designed for 300 patients, there are close to 900.</li>
<li>Napoleon curses under his breath</li>
<li>“Are there soldiers with the Spanish flu?” Napoleon asks</li>
<li>Napoleon thinks back to an article by the Star posted yesterday, in a military camp with polish-american volunteers in niagara on the lake they reported 188 cases of the flu which is spreading in the united states</li>
<li>Michener says “I don’t know anything, but i can tell you this, there are men in the military camps at the RAF in hamilton that have it”</li>
<li>They put the patient in the stretcher on an empty bed</li>
<li>There are about 10 left to go</li>
<li>Michener says he heard Colonel Hardy speak of 200 people who had the flu</li>
<li>Michener says that sometimes he wishes he could switch places with one of the sick sometimes, spending the day in a comfortable bed.</li>
<li>He says the RAF recruits are housed in a warehouse at Jesse Kechum elementary school. They’re given pine beds and some blankets. Not even straw. It’s hard as rock.</li>
<li>Napoleon retains his anger. This guy who wants to have fun flying planes. knows nothing of suffering he thinks.</li>
<li>If he thinks lying in a hard bed is suffering, he’ll have to lie in the mud of a trench with bullets raining around him to see real suffering.</li>
<li>Bouvier calms himself down because attacking Michener would be a mistake, it is better to maintain good relations. With this wealth of information if he wants to survive in the hospital with difficult conditions.</li>
<li>They remove another patient from a truck</li>
<li>The day before, Corine’s father had shown him an article from “le devoir” talking about the eucharistic congress (eucharist is a christian meeting where a bunch of people eat a meal together) in Victoriaville. It attracted 25,000 people between sept 12-16. Since then, the town’s college has been closed because numerous cases of Spanish flu have been reported there.</li>
<li>This illness that’s ravaging around europe and the united states, will it spread to Canada? Napoleon has a bad feeling</li>
<li>Julie must have some news. He thinks. At least she’ll know what precautions to take.</li>

<ul>
<li>They’re praying for the end of the war, at the suggestion of Vicar Lusier</li>
<li>All the faithful of the sacre coeur bow their heads in prayer</li>
<li>For four years this war has changed countless lives and ended millions</li>
<li>Although, on this sunday they’re ignoring another calamity aside from the war across the ocean that’s ready to battle them more directly (the flu)</li>
<li>After this, Napoleon locates Julie and asks her to join him and corine on a walk</li>
<li>She accepts, and with a girl on each side he walks along Church road</li>
<li>I must make people jealous, he says to the two</li>
<li>The trio arrives at Allan Gardens where they stroll quietly observing the other wakers and the flora already marked by the colors of Autumn</li>
<li>The two women exchange commentary in a stream of words and laughters that pleases Napoleon</li>
<li>They get along wonderfully he notes, he thinks he’s really lucky to have them in his life, especially right now.</li>
<li>He no longer thought about the evening he opened up his heart to Julie</li>
<li>Or at least he manages to chase it away everytime it appears</li>
<li>Corine says look over there. There’s a family all wearing purple armbands, she wonders if their son was on the list of war dead in yesterday’s paper.</li>
<li>While it is recommended that parents of killed soldiers wear purple armbands instead of a mourning costume. It doesn’t make them forget the war any less.</li>
<li>Napoleon cannot hide his bitterness. His thoughts go out to those who are still in the trenches, and the new men who are going to be brought in by the conscription in the following weeks. Who will have to report to the enlistment centers or risk being chased by the police.</li>
<li>He slowly draws his friends away from the sad reminder of the cost of the lives of the war.</li>
<li><strong>Tired of wearing his soldier uniform that drew admiring glances from passersby, Napoleon dressed in his Sunday best, risking being attacked by patriotic women who attack young men in civilian clothing, who guilt-trip them for not volunteering in the war</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>The act is call feathering (plumage) where they throw chicken feathers at young men (Calling them</strong> <em><strong>chickens</strong></em>)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>This years Autumn, which is usually Napoleon’s favorite season, only brings him gloomy thoughts.</li>
<li>September has been one of the coldest and rainiest months Toronto has ever seen.</li>
<li>He suddenly turns to Julie and asks what the talk is at the hospital of the Spanish flu</li>
<li>Not much she says. Doctors are discussing precautions and severity and the united states especially boston where the flu spreads rapidly</li>
<li>Napoleon isn’t entirely happy by this response thought, as he feels she’s hiding something</li>
<li>Napoleon can’t believe the public health authorities aren’t talking about the flu more. It’s taken hold at the base hospital he notes.</li>
<li>Julie grips Napoleon’s arm. She says the authorities might be afraid of causing a panic since…</li>
<li>Corine and Napoleon encourage her to continue her thought. And after a long silence she continues</li>
<li>It’s not just among the military anymore. It will probably be in the newspaper tomorrow. A twelve-year old American girl died from the flu at the general hospital on wednesday. She was traveling with her parents on a train from Delaware. During the journey she fell ill, and they admitted her to the hospital as soon as they arrived in Toronto.</li>
<li>Napoleon thinks that his work at the hospital may have sent him back to the frontlines, but this time the enemy is invisible, and takes possession of ti’s victims’ bodies. By being at the hospital, he may be exposing those he loves to this threat.</li>
<li>We should head back. Corine says</li>
<li>He’s now being guided by the two women.</li>
<li>Despite the fact that his right arm grows better day by day he experiences a sense of powerlessness, the same powerlessness he felt in the trenches, the idea of not advancing or backing up</li>

<ul>
<li>Opening the Toronto star, he realizes Julie is wrong. There is not a mention of  a girl who died but two</li>
<li>On top of the american girl, there’s a torontonian, a student from jesse ketchum, referred to with only her last name “Robertson”, succumbed to the spanish flu at the general hospital</li>
<li>There is mention of 12 other known cases of the flu in the population as well</li>
<li>Although, the chief of medicine in Ontario, Dr McCullough still thinks special measures are not necessary</li>
<li>Napoleon is not so sure, he reads in the newspaper 30-40% of communities touched by the illness will be affected, and the illness is expected to last 4-6 weeks</li>
<li>Napoleon crumples the newspaper and with a heavy heart joins his platoon on their way to the base hospital for another day of work</li>
<li>“We’re heading straight into a lion’s den, but the sick soldiers need to be cared for”</li>
<li>It’s the same as hesitating in the trenches to provide aid and do my duty. I wouldn’t hesitate to care for the wounded.</li>
<li>Shortly after after arriving at the hospital he is approached by Michener who hands him a gas mask</li>
<li>Put this on. It’s protocol now at the hospital. Yesterday, we admitted fifty new flu cases. It’s all hands on deck now.</li>
<li>Napoleon covers his mouth with the mask, for a brief moment he recalls putting on a gas mask before launching an attack at Passchendaele a year ago.
<ul>
<li>The murmurs of nurses, soldiers, and patients in the hospital are nothing like the deafening explosions of artillery shells
<ul>
<li>but Napoleon fears that the battle he’s entering may be just as deadly as that grim experience.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>They have to fumigate. Michener tells him. The smoke is supposed to kill the germs.</li>
<li>A doctor approaches them and gives them brief instructions and hands them a cylinder with a thin hose. The two men lay out blankets on a clothesline and treat them with the thin vapor.</li>
<li>Through his mask he can smell the pungent disinfectant.</li>
<li>He hopes it atleast does something</li>
<li>Over the next few hours they fumigate</li>
<li>During the break Michener asks if Napoleon read the newspaper</li>
<li>Napoleon says he read the toronto star, and asked if the girl was from the shool where his group was stationed</li>
<li>Michener said yes, but he asked if he had the article from the Globe and Mail, where it says it’s the same flu that hit spain. And they should prepare for the worst. A total of one in three people got sick, eight million</li>
<li>Napoleon is shaken. He lowers his mask to breathe deeply. He then thinks that despite the flu taking more lives more rapidly than the war it is talked about even less than the military horrors filtered through censorship</li>
<li>Dr.Boyd finds the two and asks them to follow him.</li>
<li>Napoleon asks how many are sick with the flu</li>
<li>Boyd hesitates but says close to 500, their resources are being pushed to the limit</li>
<li>As they pass the beds in the hallway Michener points out that even those beds are more comfortable. He asks the doctor if he seems a bit pale jokingly (hoping he can get a bed)</li>
<li>He’s used to the antics of Michener, by this point and just blows it off</li>
<li>Napoleon asks that if it continues to spread will we end up like spain</li>
<li>The dr lowers his voice, he says he doesn’t think so. The population is less concentrated than in Spain, and they’ve learned lessons from other cities hit by the flu.</li>
<li>He also says that we’ve noticed that flu kills people in the prime of their life, and in perfect health.</li>
<li>⅔ of victims are under 30</li>
<li>Like me! Napoleon says</li>
<li>The doctor attempts to reassure him. Michener then says what does it matter if i get sick, at least i’ll have a bed.</li>
<li>Napoleon smiles, he appreciates Michener’s efforts to lighten up the mood</li>
<li>They arrive at two patients completely covered. The doctor instructs them to take them down to the morgue, remove their covers and fumigate them.</li>
<li>Two questions haunt Napoleon, how many will die and how many more will he have to move</li>

<ul>
<li>He’s riding a wagon, the windows are wide open in order to circulate new air, conforming to orders placed by the chief of medicine of toronto, Dr.Hasting</li>
<li>The decision made by Napoleon to not take public transport also conforms to a suggestion made</li>
<li>It seems avoiding contact with people is the best way to avoid the flu, as it’s transported by air</li>
<li>The emptied beds made by Napoleon and his colleague were soon enough filled by the sick</li>
<li>Another civilian dead, a man 32, which follows ten other deaths</li>
<li>Hasting made a statement. “It’s certainly in Toronto, there’s no doubt. If it’s anything like Boston, i’m sure the situation could be equally as bad”</li>
<li>He adds that he sees no reason that even more measures should be made like closing down schools and closing down spots of entertainment</li>
<li>Napoleon puts into question the opinion of the chief. According to the journal this morning in Ottawa the municipality discredited the closing of schools, theaters, and cinemas</li>
<li>Napoleon is heading to the Spadina hospital. Julie left him a message telling him to arrive ASAP.</li>
<li>He enters the hospital to find Julie doing her job, and the bed normally occupied by Ted occupied by a stranger</li>
<li>Ted is in isolation with the other patients that have the flu, that’s why I called you. Julie says.</li>
<li>Two days ago his isolation began.</li>
<li>He complained about his throat being sore. But when he started coughing they isolated him.</li>
<li>His case escalated very rapidly.</li>
<li>They approach Ted, he’s coughing violently, while a nurse removes red mucus coming from his mouth.</li>
<li>His eyes are closed and his complexion is blue-ish, almost black. His corps is desperately grasping for air.</li>
<li>Ted finally opens his eyes and says “frenchy”</li>
<li>Is the groan a salutation or a goodbye Napoleon thinks</li>
<li>This time, he can’t jump into the mud to save his friend</li>
<li>Today, it’s not just his arm that he risks losing</li>
<li>Another round of coughs happens from Ted, and then nothing</li>
<li>Napoleon tries to reach for his friend but julie stops him</li>
<li>The nurse covers Ted’s hideous expression (signifying his death)</li>
<li>“Its over” says Julie softly while tugging him towards the exit</li>
<li>Napoleon who’s fighting against his tears lets himself cry</li>
<li>After some silence Napoleon says “it’s horrible. To die like that after serving on the front lines”</li>
<li>Julie with watery eyes says “It’s demoralizing but we can’t give up”</li>
<li>Napoleon takes Julie’s hand in his.</li>
<li>“You’re right, I won’t give up” he says</li>
<li>Waging war against an invisible enemy that attacks everyone, both the strong and the weak, will require exceptional compassion, altruism, and efforts. In Napoleon’s eyes she sees determination, the kind that the cruelty of the enemy inspires in warriors.  “At least in the war, we will win by saving lives, not taking them.” Julie thinks</li>

<ul>
<li>Corine, standing beside her sisters and parents on the steps of the Sacre-Coeur church</li>
<li>She observes the somber expression of the paroissiens, there’s a proclamation posted on the church’s main door by hastings and the mayor</li>
<li>As of October  1918 and until further notice:
<ul>
<li>Theaters and cinemas will be closed and remain closed</li>
<li>Churches and chapels of all denominations will be closed and remain closed on sundays</li>
<li>All schools public or private or sunday school must close and remain closed</li>
<li>Visits to the hospital are not allowed</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>We’ve never seen this before! Church being closed. Exclaimed Charles Sirois</li>
<li>Certain families scared by the menace of the flu walk away without asking questions.</li>
<li>But others like the Sirois remain in place to discuss with the others but these draconian laws (excessively harsh laws)</li>
<li>At least Father Lamarche and Vicar Lussier are still able to speak to the people exclaims Matheiu Sauriol</li>
<li>In a message by Lamrache, he indicates the availability of the priests to speak to the people  from the rectory even if they can’t celebrate at the mass</li>
<li>It’s going from bad to worse. Curses Brigitte Roy</li>
<li>For the past two weeks, the sick and the dead have been multiplying. Over the past week, medical authorities have been providing almost daily grim reports.</li>
<li>On October 11th, forty new cases of the flu were added to the approximately six hundred already counted in the city. That day, 19 deaths were attributed to the flu or to the pneumonia resulting in a total of 72 deaths</li>
<li>An old hotel, the Mossop has been requisitioned by the medical authorities to be converted into a hospital for people affected by the flu</li>
<li>Workers have torn up and burned the carpets to make room for 200 patients</li>
<li>Furthermore, Toronto is not the only city grappling with the epidemic</li>
<li>Winnipeg and Montreal have also declared the closure of public places</li>
<li>In the small town of Brantford, 85 km southwest of Toronto, there are reports of 2500 flu cases</li>
<li>Anxious about all the bad news she’s relieved to finally see Napoleon.</li>
<li>He’s surprised to see everyone gathered outside the church instead of inside, he questions Corine.</li>
<li>And she updates him on the tragic events.</li>
<li>She asks him to go for a walk since she wants to escape talk of the flu</li>
<li>Napoleon starts to walk with her when a stout lady named Lisa Charlebois arrives in a hurry</li>
<li>She’s out of breath, but suddenly she announces to everyone that “Little Emma Latour was taken by the flu last night”</li>
<li>Everyone including Corine and Napoleon are stunned</li>
<li>“Poor little one, she was barely two years old” Corien’s mother with a solemn tone says/</li>
<li>This news prompts new life into the gloomy conversation Prompting Corine and Napoleon to slip away.</li>
<li>First, she tells Napoleon about her day at the factory. But alas the conversation shifts to the flu as the primary subject. There is an increasing shortage of female workers at the factory; some are flailing ill, while others are staying home to care for a bedridden family member</li>
<li>Shortly after they stroll down Sackville street and pass by the sacre-coeur school. They both agree to linger and contemplate the building</li>
<li>“Children like me who weren’t very good at studies are probably quite happy that school is closed” says Napoleon</li>
<li>Corine releases her grip on Napoleon’s arm. “Surely they’re not happy to see their friends and family fall ill from the flu”</li>
<li>Napoleon accepts the reproach; his joke was probably in poor taste.</li>
<li>Although, after more than two weeks fighting against the flu, he desperately seeks humor like his comrades, especially like Ted McKenna, who did it in the trenches, and even at the worst moments.</li>
<li>In addition to carrying out his soldier duties at the Base Hospital, Napoleon volunteered to assist charitable groups delivering food to the increasingly numerous households where all the residents, afflicted with the flu, can no longer go out.
<ul>
<li>In some homes, bedridden patients can’t even prepare their own meals.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>”Not long ago, we were in school,” Napoleon says in a soft voice, inclining his head slightly towards the building.
<ul>
<li>”Yet, it feels like centuries,” Corine adds
<ul>
<li>”But unlike you,” the young woman completes in her mind, “I dream of going back.”</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Should she bring up the topic now? She ponders this question as they resume walking.</li>
<li>”You know, I probably won’t be at the munitions factory for much longer. Everyone says the end of the war is very close, a matter of days, at most weeks.”</li>
<li>Napoleon has heard such predictions before, but why did people think they had the advantage this time?</li>
<li>”As soon as there’s a ceasefire, production will stop, and I won’t have a job anymore. And you’ll likely be discharged from the army shortly after.” Corine says</li>
<li>”She’s right, but I don’t have the strength to think about it right now.” He thinks.</li>
<li>Completely absorbed in the present, imagining life after the army, after the flu epidemic, if they can make it that far, seems impossible to him.</li>
<li>For the past two weeks, in his dreams, it’s no longer the faces of Corine or Julie that he sees, but the open mouth of Ted McKenna, calling out to him just before he passed away.
<ul>
<li>Every day, he gazes into the eyes of the dying that remind him of his deceased friend. One day, he helped move twelve bodies in just a few hours.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>”How is your friend Roland?” Corine abruptly changes the subject. She has sensed Napoleon’s torment and decides to postpone the discussion about their future for a more appropriate time.</li>
<li>”Michener? His wish was granted. Even though the flu knocked him down for a few days, the doctors believe he’s out of danger now.”</li>
<li>The mention of his comical colleague, whom he had described at length to Corine, brings a smile to his lips.</li>
<li>A week ago, the aspiring pilot finally got a hospital bed as a flu-afflicted patient. After two days in a feverish delirium, Michener was transported to a less crowded hospital.</li>
<li>”I will probably never see him again,” Napoleon continues. “He will miss me nonetheless, that good-for-nothing.”</li>
<li>Their walk brings them to Bright Street, where they pass by number ten.</li>
<li>”Look, they’ve hung the white mourning cloth,” Corine says.</li>
<li>Napoleon follows Corine’s gaze. On the door of the house, he can see the white fabric indicating the death of a child, in this case, that of Emma Latour.</li>
<li>For a moment, Corine considers going to offer her condolences to the Latour family, who frequents her father’s store. But she decides to wait and accompany her parents there later.</li>
<li>Further down the quiet residential street, the couple notices other mourning cloths: a black one, signifying the death of a middle-aged adult, and a purple one to indicate the passing of an elderly person.</li>
<li>Corine suddenly turns to Napoleon.</li>
<li>”I’m going to offer my services to the S.O.S.”</li>
<li>Napoleon takes the young woman’s arms. “Don’t do that!“. He says.</li>
<li>Corine is surprised by his reaction because joining the new auxiliary nursing corps, the Sisters of Service or S.O.S., seems to her the best way to make a direct contribution to the fight against the flu.
<ul>
<li>The call for volunteers from the Ontario Chief Medical Officer has just been published in the newspapers.</li>
<li>She thought she would please Napoleon, get closer to him by going to the front herself to combat the flu enemy.</li>
</ul>

<li>”Julie is already risking her life. I couldn’t bear to see both of you in the lion’s cage.”</li>

<li>”It’s here,” says Napoleon to the driver, who parks the car, an old Ford, on the side of Davenport Street.</li>
<li>The driver turns off the engine as Napoleon (in uniform even though he’s not on duty, at least not for the army), steps out of the car and opens the back door for Julie.</li>
<li>The nurse, also in her professional attire, exits the Ford as well.</li>
<li>The soldier takes the pot of hot soup from her hands.</li>
<li>Julie and Napoleon move towards a modest shack at 79 Davenport Street</li>
<li>A modest cottage at 79 Davenport Street.</li>
<li>He takes pleasure in accompanying the nurse in her work, despite the circumstances.</li>
<li>Like her, Napoleon volunteered to help families struck by the flu.</li>
<li>Julie managed to arrange for Napoleon to be included in her S.O.S. team.</li>
<li>After her shift at the hospital, Julie joins the 400 female volunteers who make visits to homes affected by the flu, delivering hot meals and, to the best of their ability, medical care.</li>
<li>Many vehicle owners, like the driver of the Ford, have put their cars into service for this reason.</li>
<li>The nurse and the soldier arrive at the door and, before knocking, they cover their mouths with their masks.</li>
<li>“I wonder if the masks really help?”
<ul>
<li>This question has been bothering Napoleon for days because, despite this precaution, the disease continues to spread at an alarming rate.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>October 21 marks the third week of the flu’s incursion into Toronto</li>
<li>Is the worst already here, or is it yet to come? That’s the other question that Napoleon asks.</li>
<li>79 Davenport Street is one of the ten thousand homes where the city’s postmen have left a special card.</li>
<li>This measure allows people struck by the flu to communicate their condition and needs to the medical authorities, as most households do not have telephones.</li>
<li>The city has only 60,000 of them.</li>
<li>Julie and Napoleon wait in silence. The soldier knocks again.
<ul>
<li>The absence of any sound from inside disturbs him, evoking memories from Europe, in war-ravaged villages where his comrades  went door-to-door to check for civilians or hidden enemies.</li>
<li>This moment, standing before the door, the uncertainty before taking action, was the worst, Napoleon remembers, the time when they feared discovering a terrible and deadly secret inside.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>For the third time, Napoleon knocks. Still, nothing.</li>
<li>A few more silent seconds pass. The nurse reaches for the knob and turns it. The door opens. Without hesitation, Julie enters the house.</li>
<li>Napoleon follows closely behind and places a hand on her shoulder.</li>
<li>”Wait. I’ll go in first.&quot;</li>
<li>&quot;Is anyone here?” he asks loudly.</li>
<li>Still, the same eerie silence. Instinctively, Napoleon’s fists clench as if he were holding his rifle.</li>
<li>He returns to the entrance, but Julie is gone; he sees her ascending the stairs leading to the upper floor where there are supposed to be bedrooms, and…</li>
<li>A man and a woman lie motionless in a bed.</li>
<li>Julie checks their pulses, but based on the gray, bluish hue of the victims, Napoleon already knows that the flu has claimed them, a diagnosis that Julie confirms by covering both the deceased with the bed’s blanket.</li>
<li>The calm demeanor of the young woman elicits admiration from Napoleon, who is deeply shaken.</li>
<li>They arrived too late.</li>
<li>“Even if we had come while they were still alive, we would have always been too late,” Bouvier reflects. “Once it chooses its prey, we can do nothing against the flu. It determines who lives and who dies.”</li>
<li>His eyes avoid Julie’s, and it’s then that he notices the cradle in a dark corner of the room.</li>
<li>He rushes to it with hope and retrieves a baby.</li>
<li>But right after, a chill runs through his hands and then his whole body.</li>
<li>Julie examines the infant and sadly shakes her head. Napoleon places the lifeless child on the bed with its parents.</li>
<li>Suddenly, a sharp noise rings in the air, first once, then a second time. A cough in the neighboring room!</li>
<li>The soldier and the nurse find a boy of approximately seven years old</li>
<li>He’s struggling to breathe</li>
<li>Julie asks Napoleon to take him downstairs quickly</li>
<li>The frail body weighs almost nothing, he rushes down the stairs where Julie waits with a glass of water</li>
<li>She manages to get a few drops down his throat but he’s severely dehydrated</li>
<li>His pneumonia has reached an advanced stage ulie explains</li>
<li>Time is of the essence, they rush to the car and Julie informs the driver to get to the hospital as quickly as possible.</li>
<li>Fortunately in the early evening the car can speed through the streets like an ambulance, as it encounters little traffic</li>
<li>The Driver asks “What about the parents”</li>
<li>Julie keeps feeding the child water slowly</li>
<li>They end up at university ave hospital</li>
<li>The duo brings the child into the hospital</li>
<li>It was built right before the war
<strong>PG: 112</strong></li>
<li>Julie goes to call the health services to deal with the parents of the child</li>

<li>It’s really over, Napoleon.</li>
<li>Without answering, he hugs her</li>
<li>Nearby, the fire in the street grows and they approach it to warm up.</li>
<li>a few men make their way to an alley far from the blaze, where a delivery wagon(Wooden Car) lies without its owner.</li>

<li>Napoleon arrives at the Spadina Military Hospital, he was surprised to find another nurse at Julie’s post.</li>
<li>She’s been at the General Hospital for three days with the flu</li>
<li>Napoleon makes his way to the General Hospital where his emotions and thoughts leave him momentarily disoriented.</li>
<li>The image of the little boy he carried into the hospital in his arms just two weeks ago still haunts him.</li>
<li>A nurse wearing a mask listens to his request to see patient Arsenault. She warns him of the risks.</li>
<li>” I know them well,” he says curtly. I’ve been working with flu patients for over a month.”</li>
<li>The nurse hands him a formaldehyde-coated mask.</li>
<li>He enters the room</li>
<li>”Julie” he says</li>
<li>She coughs and opens her eyes: We’ve won, Napoleon.</li>
<li>Napoleon responds in the affirmative</li>
<li>”No, We’ve beaten the flu”</li>
<li>Napoleon is stunned. How can she speak of victory when she’s fighting for her life?
<ul>
<li>She coughs and spits blood</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>You’ll get better.</li>
<li>And are you cured now? (Talking about his arm)</li>
<li>Are you going back to boxing?</li>
<li>If it were Corine asking him that question, he’d say no. He takes Julie’s hand in his and fights his desire to tear off his mask and kiss her.</li>
<li>I love you, Julie.</li>
<li>I didn’t ask you that, she says</li>
<li>”Yes,” he finally whispers.</li>
<li>Napoléon..</li>
<li>Go and ask Father Lussier to come.</li>
<li>Unable to hide his fear, Napoleon says:</li>
<li>You can’t…, says napoleon</li>
<li>No…But I’m going to confess anyway.</li>
<li>Julie closes her eyes and falls asleep.</li>
<li>He finds a telephone and calls the presbytery of Sacré-Coeur church.</li>
<li>Rodrigue Lussier didn’t hesitate to drop everything and go to the patient’s bedside.</li>
<li>”So it’s over,” the priest murmurs softly.</li>
<li>No, Monsieur l’abbé, not really. Julie may have left us, but the flu is still with us.</li>
<li>Once outside the hospital, Napoleon swallows large gulps of air, recalling his last moments with the courageous nurse. “Yes, Julie, we’ve won, but now, for me, there’ll never be a victory.”</li>

<p>News from  Toronto Star</p>
<ul>
<li>Page 6: Octobre dernier, ce sombre mois:</li>
</ul>
<p><code>Parmi les 7 634 personnes qui sont mortes à Toronto l’an dernier, environ 2 700 de celles-ci ont été les victimes de la grippe espagnole et de la pneumonie, et de ce nombre, plus de 2000 sont mortes au cours de « ce sombre mois » d’octobre dernier et au cours des deux mois suivants, au moment où l’épidémie de ces maladies a ravagé la ville.</code></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Napoleon sighs over the situation in Toronto after a harsh winter.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Toronto faced extreme cold and a coal shortage due to influenza-related production delays.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Coal stocks had dropped by 5,000 tons a day during the worst times, impacting heating for homes.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Quebec and Ontario were the hardest-hit provinces, with high influenza cases and fatalities.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Quebec had 535,700 cases and 13,880 deaths, while Ontario had 300,000 cases and 8,705 deaths.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In the United States, 1 in 4 people contracted the disease, resulting in a death toll of around 600,000, or 2% of the population.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The young man is on a quest and is reading about the Paris Peace Conference.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The conference involves representatives from twenty-seven victorious powers negotiating the terms of a peace treaty for Germany since January 18.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Negotiations face challenges related to reparations and defining new boundaries for countries affected by the war.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The Spanish flu is also a concern, with a third wave in December and January causing 3,000 deaths in Paris.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Napoleon curses and turns to the next pages. In the sports section, he finally finds it</p>
<ul>
<li>Tomorrow evening, at the Connelly Sports Center, young Torontonian Frenchy Bouvier returns to the ring in his first fight since September 1916. He takes on Ted Walsh of Montreal in a match that promises to be a hard-fought affair, given Walsh’s reputation for fighting spirit.</li>
<li>
<ul>
<li>Napoleon proudly displays a newspaper on his dresser.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>He has been training intensively for the past four months to regain his boxing form.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>His trainer, Fred Bélanger, advised him to wait a few more months before fighting, especially against a tough opponent like Walsh.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Napoleon is eager to return to boxing sooner because he’s running out of savings and needs money.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The job market in Toronto has become competitive due to the repatriation and demobilization of servicemen and the end of war contracts.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Napoleon is reluctant to return to his old job at the Gendron factory.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Napoleon reads the two lines about himself and notices the use of his nickname “Frenchy.”</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It’s the first time he officially uses this nickname, a decision that Corine had criticized.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Despite its lack of originality or elegance, the nickname “Frenchy” reflects his origins and language, which fill him with immense pride.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This nickname is used by his army comrades and English speakers to refer to him.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>He is proud to share his culture</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The boxer checks the time and realizes that his final training session before the fight is about to begin.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>He puts on his coat and contemplates whether Corine will keep her promise.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>He is concerned about the possibility of feeling alone in the ring during the upcoming fight, despite his best efforts to overcome this fear.</p>

<ul>
<li>Corine is outside the Connelly Sports Center</li>
<li>She is hesitant of if she wants to watch
<ul>
<li>She eventually decided to go</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>”Frenchy Bouvier”, Corine reads, admiring the photo of Napoleon</li>
<li>He does not like the name too much but he looks good</li>
<li>hasn’t forgotten the last time she came to watch him and give her heart and soul to his passion.</li>
<li>fearful and tormented, she feels unable to keep her promise to Napoleon.</li>
<li>I’ve got to at least try,” she finally says to herself. I owe him that.” With a determined gesture, she pushes open the door.</li>
<li>At the ticket office, she collects the ticket left for her and enters the arena.</li>
<li><strong>”Come on, Frenchy, hit him!”</strong></li>
<li>
<ul>
<li>Corine feels the urge to shout as well, wanting to tell Napoleon to stop before he gets injured.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>She notices blood above his right eye, adding to her concern for his well-being.</li>
<li>Bouvier hears Fred Bélanger’s voice: he must avoid or parry his opponent’s fearsome blows if he hopes to get the better of him.</li>
<li>As always, the strategy, so easy to articulate, proves difficult to put into practice.</li>
<li>The bell announcing the end of the second round rings strangely in Napoleon’s head.</li>
<li>The bell rings announcing the end of the second round.</li>
<li>The flyweight boxer is relieved to have a short break as he retreats to his corner.</li>
<li>His trainer, Bélanger, tends to him, providing care and advice.</li>
<li>The cold water refreshes him and provides some energy.</li>
<li>However, he struggles to fully comprehend or hear Bélanger’s words, as if they are distorted and unclear, possibly due to the exhaustion or intensity of the fight.</li>
<li>
<ul>
<li>Bélanger advises the boxer to make his opponent extend his right hand, suggesting it will create an opportunity for a left-hand attack.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The boxer nods in acknowledgment and takes a moment to look around the stands.</li>
<li>He spots familiar faces in the crowd, including former soldiers from his unit, friends from the Gendron factory, and even Count Rochereau de la Sablière.</li>
<li>Throughout the match, the boxer has been hoping that Corine, the person he desires, is also in the audience.</li>
<li>
<ul>
<li>The bell rings, signaling the start of another round.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Napoleon, despite his exhaustion, quickly gets up with a strong determination to win the fight.</li>
<li>He employs a risky strategy, attempting to draw Walsh’s powerful right hand, but in doing so, he puts himself at risk of a knockout punch.</li>
<li>
<ul>
<li>The fight continues, with Walsh being a more robust and less graceful boxer compared to Bouvier.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Napoleon’s bruised and swollen face and body show the impact of Walsh’s powerful blows.</li>
<li>Bouvier adjusts his movements and tactics, using jerky motions to evade Walsh’s attacks and block his punches with his gloves.</li>
<li>He creates an opening for a counterattack but gets hit hard by Walsh in the jaw.</li>
<li>Napoleon falls to the ground, blood escaping from his mouth, and he feels a displaced tooth with his tongue.</li>
<li>The crowd’s excitement and screams intensify, and Corine, like many other spectators, stands up in shock.</li>
<li>She expresses her distress, rushing toward the exit with her hands covering her ears to block out the noise, unable to bear witnessing the violent scene.</li>
<li>…two, three…</li>
<li>Napoleon is on the ground</li>
<li>Outside, Corine takes in the refreshing spring night air and leans against a wall to catch her breath.</li>
<li>She reflects on the fact that she will have to admit to Napoleon that she had to leave the fight.</li>
<li>While she could have been his wife, she was never meant to be his nurse; her true calling was teaching.</li>
<li>She’s dedicated to ensuring the education of French-Canadians in her English-speaking town, helping them preserve their language and culture.</li>
<li>She understands the importance of the fight against regulations like Regulation 17 and the ban on French in Franco-Ontarian schools.</li>
<li>Corine is determined to fight for their cause in her own way, in the classroom, and she believes Napoleon will understand that they each have their own destinies, even if it means giving up their journey together.</li>
<li>Despite her pain, Corine accepts this path.</li>
<li>Corine takes one last deep breath and begins to walk, determined to follow her own path, even if it means walking alone.</li>
<li>Meanwhile, in the ring, Bouvier manages to save his eye but takes a powerful hit to the jaw from Walsh.</li>
<li>Napoleon falls to the ground, blood escaping from his mouth, and he feels his displaced tooth with his tongue.</li>

<li>Overwhelmed, Corine rushes towards the exit with her hands covering her ears to block out the noise, unable to bear witnessing the brutal scene any longer.</li>
<li>…two, three…</li>
<li>Napoleon in the Ring:</li>
<li>Lying on his stomach, exhausted and panting.</li>
<li>Hearing the countdown to his defeat, distant like voices in the snow.</li>
<li>Realizing that victory may slip away.</li>
<li>Experiencing physical pain and disappointment but holding onto hope.</li>
<li>Breathing in the refreshing spring night air.</li>
<li>Taking a moment to collect herself against a wall.</li>
<li>Reflecting on her role as a teacher and her mission.</li>
<li>Committed to preserving the language and culture of French-Canadians.</li>
<li>Aware of the challenges they face and the need to fight against oppressive policies.</li>
<li>Determined to fight in her own way, using her classroom as her “ring.”</li>
<li>Believing that Napoleon will understand their separate destinies.</li>
<li>Accepting the necessity of giving up their shared journey.</li>
<li>Walking alone with certainty that she’s on the right path for herself.</li>

<li>Four years ago (1912), le reglement XVII (17) passed. It said that all bilingual schools in ontario must stop teaching in french from the third grade</li>
<li>The injustice motivated Corine to become a teacher so she could teach french and protect her culture and language, helping french canadians conserve their identity, even if she has to hide she’s teaching in french</li>
<li>She dreams of becoming a teacher and returning to her elementary school. She has a strong conviction that the students of sacre-coeur need her as a teacher, they need a francophone</li>
<li>She wants to teach all her life, or at least till she gets married (if ever, she thinks)</li>
<li>She thinks to herself “What are the English afraid of, after all the Italians are just as numerous as the French, how is learning our language in school a danger to them?”</li>
