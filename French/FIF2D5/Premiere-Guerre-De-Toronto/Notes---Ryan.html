<ul>
<li>
<p>It’s been a year since he’s enlisted</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When he enlisted, the enlister called him “Bouvier, like the dog”</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>He’s in the middle of a boxing match</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>He gets knocked down, he sees the gray sky, the mounds of earth, the barbed wire, the mud, and his comrades in their uniforms surrounding him</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>“Had enough frenchy”, Ted Mckenna (his opponent) says</p>
<ul>
<li>He gets up and nods no</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>He’s in battalion 48 Highlanders de toronto</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>He’s made some friends but also encountered hostility</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Quebec’s growing opposition to the war, and especially to the Canadian government’s conscription plan, prompted some english Canadians to accuse french Canadians of a lack of patriotism</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Arriving at the Valcartier military training camp, Napoleon met soldiers from the 22nd battalion</p>
<ul>
<li>Having found himself in the 22nd battalion he surely would have avoided the prejudices to which he was victim</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>When one of the soldiers in his regiment recognized Bouvier, he proclaimed in front of the others that their unit had among there’s a frenchy, and an outstanding boxer</p>
<ul>
<li>They called him by the nickname frenchy since he is a french Canadian, and the english don’t really like french canadians</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>However, he detected in some soldiers a hurtful tone when they spoke to him</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>By January 1917 they had sailed to England. And after a few weeks of training in a miserable muddy camp, he was now up in the country of his ancestors</p>
<ul>
<li>He thought he had gone through the worst, but that couldn’t be further from the truth</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>His battalion was commanded by from the top by the British generals</p>
<ul>
<li>They were launched into a succession of battles</li>
<li>Nothing would’ve prepared him for the horrors of war</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Even when the army had victory it was little consolation for the amount of lives lost</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>On April 9th 1917 they took control of Vimy Ridge, something though to be impossible by the British</p>
<ul>
<li>The price of this victory was 3600 deaths</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Napoleon who has accustomed to punching his opponents down was shocked to see bullets from his rifle take down opponents down instead</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>After Vimy they got a short rest, but things quickly became miserable due to the lose of life</p>
<ul>
<li>They would win a couple more battles but it didn’t matter</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>The bad conditions caused a gloomy mood in the air</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>And repressed aggression from Canadians caused them to attack their own brother’s in arms</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Mckenna issued a challenge to Bouvier for a boxing match</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Mckenna expected him to back away but he didn’t he’d had enough of the Orangiste</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>They fought bare fist, bare chest</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>After they fight a bit, and Napoleon comes back in the fight and knocks McKenna down Colonel Davis comes in and tells them to stop, and to save it for the germans</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Mckenna says “you win this time Frenchy”</p>

<li>
<p>One step at a time, despite their heavy losses the Canadians persisted against the German defenses at Passchendaele.</p>

<li>
<p>The mud cuts down their ranks the most. Dozens of soldiers fall into water-filled shell crates where they end up trapped in the deadly slime and drown.</p>

</li>
<li>
<p>All his comrades supported the Borden conservatives and their promise to impose conscription in Canada.</p>

<p>But Napoleon voted for the liberal party. He was wrong to enlist and wants to prevent other young people like him from going through hell.</p>

<p>The british high command no longer has any idea over the reality of the front: they order commands as futile as they are useless like the capture of Passchendaele which was costly in lives (commanded by the general Haig)</p>

<p>Suddenly, a shell (explosive projectile from cannons) (obus eclate) explodes to the right of him and the impact forces Napoleon to the ground</p>
