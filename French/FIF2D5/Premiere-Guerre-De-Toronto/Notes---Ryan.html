<ul>
<li>
<p>It’s been a year since he’s enlisted</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When he enlisted, the enlister called him “Bouvier, like the dog”</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>He’s in the middle of a boxing match</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>He gets knocked down, he sees the gray sky, the mounds of earth, the barbed wire, the mud, and his comrades in their uniforms surrounding him</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>“Had enough frenchy”, Ted Mckenna (his opponent) says</p>
<ul>
<li>He gets up and nods no</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>He’s in battalion 48 Highlanders de toronto</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>He’s made some friends but also encountered hostility</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Quebec’s growing opposition to the war, and especially to the Canadian government’s conscription plan, prompted some english Canadians to accuse french Canadians of a lack of patriotism</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Arriving at the Valcartier military training camp, Napoleon met soldiers from the 22nd battalion</p>
<ul>
<li>Having found himself in the 22nd battalion he surely would have avoided the prejudices to which he was victim</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>When one of the soldiers in his regiment recognized Bouvier, he proclaimed in front of the others that their unit had among there’s a frenchy, and an outstanding boxer</p>
<ul>
<li>They called him by the nickname frenchy since he is a french Canadian, and the english don’t really like french canadians</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>However, he detected in some soldiers a hurtful tone when they spoke to him</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>By January 1917 they had sailed to England. And after a few weeks of training in a miserable muddy camp, he was now up in the country of his ancestors</p>
<ul>
<li>He thought he had gone through the worst, but that couldn’t be further from the truth</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>His battalion was commanded by from the top by the British generals</p>
<ul>
<li>They were launched into a succession of battles</li>
<li>Nothing would’ve prepared him for the horrors of war</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Even when the army had victory it was little consolation for the amount of lives lost</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>On April 9th 1917 they took control of Vimy Ridge, something though to be impossible by the British</p>
<ul>
<li>The price of this victory was 3600 deaths</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Napoleon who has accustomed to punching his opponents down was shocked to see bullets from his rifle take down opponents down instead</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>After Vimy they got a short rest, but things quickly became miserable due to the lose of life</p>
<ul>
<li>They would win a couple more battles but it didn’t matter</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>The bad conditions caused a gloomy mood in the air</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>And repressed aggression from Canadians caused them to attack their own brother’s in arms</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Mckenna issued a challenge to Bouvier for a boxing match</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Mckenna expected him to back away but he didn’t he’d had enough of the Orangiste</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>They fought bare fist, bare chest</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>After they fight a bit, and Napoleon comes back in the fight and knocks McKenna down Colonel Davis comes in and tells them to stop, and to save it for the germans</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Mckenna says “you win this time Frenchy”</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>For 11 days Napoleon’s section has been progressing relentlessly</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>One step at a time, despite their heavy losses the Canadians persisted against the German defenses at Passchendaele.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The mud cuts down their ranks the most. Dozens of soldiers fall into water-filled shell crates where they end up trapped in the deadly slime and drown.</p>
<ul>
<li>The Canadian troops devoted more effort into making wooden bridges to cross mud then to the assaults against the German.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Two days ago, Napoleon voted for the first time in his life in a federal election.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>All his comrades supported the Borden conservatives and their promise to impose conscription in Canada.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>But Napoleon voted for the liberal party. He was wrong to enlist and wants to prevent other young people like him from going through hell.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The british high command no longer has any idea over the reality of the front: they order commands as futile as they are useless like the capture of Passchendaele which was costly in lives (commanded by the general Haig)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Suddenly, a shell (explosive projectile from cannons) (obus eclate) explodes to the right of him and the impact forces Napoleon to the ground</p>
<ul>
<li>During a long 30 seconds, Napoleon lays in the mud and thinks about just staying there, he thinks about how this battle doesn’t matter and how if they take this town under control or not, it doesn’t matter. It’s insignificant to the war in it’s entirety.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>“Frenchy help me,” Ted screams.</p>
<ul>
<li>Bouvier snaps out of it</li>

<p>At the bottom of a crater created by the explosion, he distinguishes a large silhouette, sunk in the mud up to the waist (Ted)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>German machine gunners spot targets and open fire at Bouvier. Bullets whiz around Napoleon as he runs towards Ted</p>
<ul>
<li>Just as he reaches the crater a painful burn shoots through his right arm</li>

<li>Father Abbot Philips Lamarche is talking to Charles Sirois (Corine dad)</li>
<li>They talk for a bit then he asks for a copy of the law (this is a magazine i guess)</li>
<li>Corine, go and find it for the priest. Charles says.</li>
<li>The young woman who was listening to the conversation of the two men from the counter of her father’s store goes to the back fo the store in search for the magazine</li>
<li>When she gets back they engage in serious conversation. They talk about how the population of the city is changing.</li>
<li>Over the course of 20 years it’s doubled. Half a million inhabitants.</li>
<li>But it’s not just the number, it’s the number of immigrants, specifically immigrants from england</li>
<li>In 1901 ¾ of total people in toronto were born in Canada, now its 60%</li>
<li>People from the UK represent ⅓ of the total population with 150 000 members</li>
<li>It’s for good reason that Toronto is becoming British Charles remarks, Britain is 5 times larger in presence than it was at the beginning of the century</li>
<li>Just like Corine, the priest is used to the rants of the queen merchant (charles)</li>
<li>Charles refuses the coin handed to him by the priest for the magazine</li>
<li>Why do you think conscription is so strong in toronto the priest asks.
<ul>
<li>Charles says it’s because of all the people from england</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The priest, who doesn’t like discussing politics changes the subject by asking Corine a question</li>
<li>How is Napoleon doing Corine? He asks.
<ul>
<li>Better, and better she replies</li>
<li>She feels the priest would like her to say more, like for example her plans for the future with him (marriage)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>But Charles returns to the rescue. He mentions the big rally tomorrow to promote the army recruitment. “The so called patriots will just launch more attacks against French-Canadians”</li>
<li>I hope you’re wrong. Says the priest. He then thanks Charles and leaves the store.</li>
<li>Corine thinks about her fathers remarks, she also hopes it will be wrong.</li>

<li>Corine wants to talk her heart out to Napoleon</li>
<li>She talks about her week at the factory, but how many are staying home due to the flu</li>
<li>Napoleon says that kids are probably happy school’s out if they aren’t good at school</li>

<li>Michener got the flu, so his wish of getting a comfortable bed has finally been granted, though he was moved to a less crowded hospital</li>
<li>On the door of a house, there is a white crepe announcing the death of a child, which here is Emma Latour</li>

<li>She says he didn’t ask for it and tells him to get abbe lussier to come</li>
<li>She wants to confess</li>
<li>Lussier comes immediately</li>
<li>Lussier is crying a bit</li>
<li>”So it’s over,” the priest murmurs softly.</li>
<li>No, Monsieur l’abbé, not really. Julie may have left us, but the flu is still with us.</li>
<li>Once outside the hospital, Napoleon swallows large gulps of air, recalling his last moments with the courageous nurse. “Yes, Julie, we’ve won, but now, for me, there’ll never be a victory.”</li>

<li>Juile didn’t live in Toronto long enough to make many friends</li>
<li>Corine, Lamarche et Lussier and a few nurses from the military hospital (3)</li>
<li>It’s not really a funeral, but Lamarche is talking, while her body is being loaded on a fright train to be taken back</li>
<li>the train leaves, and the group disperes</li>

<li>Corine nods in agreement as the last carriage of the train leaves their field of vision.</li>
<li>They walk out into the confort of the sun</li>
<li>”Poor Julie, she probably won’t be the last victim,” muses Bouvier, “but probably one of the last.”</li>

<li>A lot is about to change</li>

<li>Because of the exceptional circumstances created by the war and the flu epidemic They let her in</li>
<li>She confident she will catch up</li>

<li>If this is what you really want, Corine, you have to do it.</li>

<p>News from  Toronto Star</p>
<ul>
<li>Page 6: Octobre dernier, ce sombre mois:</li>
</ul>
<p><code>Parmi les 7 634 personnes qui sont mortes à Toronto l’an dernier, environ 2 700 de celles-ci ont été les victimes de la grippe espagnole et de la pneumonie, et de ce nombre, plus de 2000 sont mortes au cours de « ce sombre mois » d’octobre dernier et au cours des deux mois suivants, au moment où l’épidémie de ces maladies a ravagé la ville.</code></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Napoleon sighs over the situation in Toronto after a harsh winter.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Toronto faced extreme cold and a coal shortage due to influenza-related production delays.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Coal stocks had dropped by 5,000 tons a day during the worst times, impacting heating for homes.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Quebec and Ontario were the hardest-hit provinces, with high influenza cases and fatalities.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Quebec had 535,700 cases and 13,880 deaths, while Ontario had 300,000 cases and 8,705 deaths.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In the United States, 1 in 4 people contracted the disease, resulting in a death toll of around 600,000, or 2% of the population.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The young man is on a quest and is reading about the Paris Peace Conference.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The conference involves representatives from twenty-seven victorious powers negotiating the terms of a peace treaty for Germany since January 18.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Negotiations face challenges related to reparations and defining new boundaries for countries affected by the war.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The Spanish flu is also a concern, with a third wave in December and January causing 3,000 deaths in Paris.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Napoleon curses and turns to the next pages. In the sports section, he finally finds it</p>
<ul>
<li>Tomorrow evening, at the Connelly Sports Center, young Torontonian Frenchy Bouvier returns to the ring in his first fight since September 1916. He takes on Ted Walsh of Montreal in a match that promises to be a hard-fought affair, given Walsh’s reputation for fighting spirit.</li>
<li>
<ul>
<li>Napoleon proudly displays a newspaper on his dresser.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>He has been training intensively for the past four months to regain his boxing form.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>His trainer, Fred Bélanger, advised him to wait a few more months before fighting, especially against a tough opponent like Walsh.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Napoleon is eager to return to boxing sooner because he’s running out of savings and needs money.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The job market in Toronto has become competitive due to the repatriation and demobilization of servicemen and the end of war contracts.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Napoleon is reluctant to return to his old job at the Gendron factory.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Napoleon reads the two lines about himself and notices the use of his nickname “Frenchy.”</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It’s the first time he officially uses this nickname, a decision that Corine had criticized.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Despite its lack of originality or elegance, the nickname “Frenchy” reflects his origins and language, which fill him with immense pride.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This nickname is used by his army comrades and English speakers to refer to him.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>He is proud to share his culture</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The boxer checks the time and realizes that his final training session before the fight is about to begin.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>He puts on his coat and contemplates whether Corine will keep her promise.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>He is concerned about the possibility of feeling alone in the ring during the upcoming fight, despite his best efforts to overcome this fear.</p>
</li>

<ul>
<li>Corine is outside the Connelly Sports Center</li>
<li>She is hesitant of if she wants to watch
<ul>
<li>She eventually decided to go</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>”Frenchy Bouvier”, Corine reads, admiring the photo of Napoleon</li>
<li>He does not like the name too much but he looks good</li>
<li>hasn’t forgotten the last time she came to watch him and give her heart and soul to his passion.</li>
<li>fearful and tormented, she feels unable to keep her promise to Napoleon.</li>
<li>I’ve got to at least try,” she finally says to herself. I owe him that.” With a determined gesture, she pushes open the door.</li>
<li>At the ticket office, she collects the ticket left for her and enters the arena.</li>
<li><strong>”Come on, Frenchy, hit him!”</strong></li>
<li>
<ul>
<li>Corine feels the urge to shout as well, wanting to tell Napoleon to stop before he gets injured.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>She notices blood above his right eye, adding to her concern for his well-being.</li>
<li>Bouvier hears Fred Bélanger’s voice: he must avoid or parry his opponent’s fearsome blows if he hopes to get the better of him.</li>
<li>As always, the strategy, so easy to articulate, proves difficult to put into practice.</li>
<li>The bell announcing the end of the second round rings strangely in Napoleon’s head.</li>
<li>The bell rings announcing the end of the second round.</li>
<li>The flyweight boxer is relieved to have a short break as he retreats to his corner.</li>
<li>His trainer, Bélanger, tends to him, providing care and advice.</li>
<li>The cold water refreshes him and provides some energy.</li>
<li>However, he struggles to fully comprehend or hear Bélanger’s words, as if they are distorted and unclear, possibly due to the exhaustion or intensity of the fight.</li>
<li>
<ul>
<li>Bélanger advises the boxer to make his opponent extend his right hand, suggesting it will create an opportunity for a left-hand attack.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The boxer nods in acknowledgment and takes a moment to look around the stands.</li>
<li>He spots familiar faces in the crowd, including former soldiers from his unit, friends from the Gendron factory, and even Count Rochereau de la Sablière.</li>
<li>Throughout the match, the boxer has been hoping that Corine, the person he desires, is also in the audience.</li>
<li>
<ul>
<li>The bell rings, signaling the start of another round.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Napoleon, despite his exhaustion, quickly gets up with a strong determination to win the fight.</li>
<li>He employs a risky strategy, attempting to draw Walsh’s powerful right hand, but in doing so, he puts himself at risk of a knockout punch.</li>
<li>
<ul>
<li>The fight continues, with Walsh being a more robust and less graceful boxer compared to Bouvier.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Napoleon’s bruised and swollen face and body show the impact of Walsh’s powerful blows.</li>
<li>Bouvier adjusts his movements and tactics, using jerky motions to evade Walsh’s attacks and block his punches with his gloves.</li>
<li>He creates an opening for a counterattack but gets hit hard by Walsh in the jaw.</li>
<li>Napoleon falls to the ground, blood escaping from his mouth, and he feels a displaced tooth with his tongue.</li>
<li>The crowd’s excitement and screams intensify, and Corine, like many other spectators, stands up in shock.</li>
<li>She expresses her distress, rushing toward the exit with her hands covering her ears to block out the noise, unable to bear witnessing the violent scene.</li>
<li>…two, three…</li>
<li>Napoleon is on the ground</li>
<li>Outside, Corine takes in the refreshing spring night air and leans against a wall to catch her breath.</li>
<li>She reflects on the fact that she will have to admit to Napoleon that she had to leave the fight.</li>
<li>While she could have been his wife, she was never meant to be his nurse; her true calling was teaching.</li>
<li>She’s dedicated to ensuring the education of French-Canadians in her English-speaking town, helping them preserve their language and culture.</li>
<li>She understands the importance of the fight against regulations like Regulation 17 and the ban on French in Franco-Ontarian schools.</li>
<li>Corine is determined to fight for their cause in her own way, in the classroom, and she believes Napoleon will understand that they each have their own destinies, even if it means giving up their journey together.</li>
<li>Despite her pain, Corine accepts this path.</li>
<li>Corine takes one last deep breath and begins to walk, determined to follow her own path, even if it means walking alone.</li>
<li>Meanwhile, in the ring, Bouvier manages to save his eye but takes a powerful hit to the jaw from Walsh.</li>
<li>Napoleon falls to the ground, blood escaping from his mouth, and he feels his displaced tooth with his tongue.</li>
<li>The crowd’s excitement and screams intensify, prompting Corine and many other spectators to stand up in shock.</li>
<li>Overwhelmed, Corine rushes towards the exit with her hands covering her ears to block out the noise, unable to bear witnessing the brutal scene any longer.</li>
<li>…two, three…</li>
<li>Napoleon in the Ring:</li>
<li>Lying on his stomach, exhausted and panting.</li>
<li>Hearing the countdown to his defeat, distant like voices in the snow.</li>
<li>Realizing that victory may slip away.</li>
<li>Experiencing physical pain and disappointment but holding onto hope.</li>
<li>Breathing in the refreshing spring night air.</li>
<li>Taking a moment to collect herself against a wall.</li>
<li>Reflecting on her role as a teacher and her mission.</li>
<li>Committed to preserving the language and culture of French-Canadians.</li>
<li>Aware of the challenges they face and the need to fight against oppressive policies.</li>
<li>Determined to fight in her own way, using her classroom as her “ring.”</li>
<li>Believing that Napoleon will understand their separate destinies.</li>
<li>Accepting the necessity of giving up their shared journey.</li>
<li>Walking alone with certainty that she’s on the right path for herself.</li>

<li>Napoleon exclaims that Julie is there</li>
<li>Napoleon gets up last second</li>
<li>Napoleon goes on to win the fight</li>
